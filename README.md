Make sure you create a folder called `./codebases` and then `git clone` your repo there. 

Make sure you have downloaded Ollama (`curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh`) and then `ollama pull codestral`


Then just run `python python_extractor.py`

It is recommended to afterwards generate a git branch called `documentation` afterwards and then generate pull request to the branch (this will done automatically in future releases)
